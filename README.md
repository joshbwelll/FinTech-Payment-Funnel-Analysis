# FinTech-Payment-Funnel-Analysis

**Executive Summary:**
A large volume of unpaid subscriptions at a fintech company revealed significant friction in the online payment experience, negatively impacting revenue. This analysis leveraged SQL and a data science notebook to build a comprehensive product funnel, identifying key drop-off points within the payment process. The findings informed strategic, data-driven recommendations to improve the conversion rate of successful payments.

**Business Problem:**
The finance team has noticed that many subscriptions haven't been paid for, so they've reached out to the product team to understand if there are any frictions points in the online payment portal so they can increase the conversion rate (% of subscriptions that are successfully converting to a paid subscription).

**Methodology:**
1. EDA
2. Product Funnel Analysis
3. Data Visualization (Tableau) 

**Skills:**
* SQL â€“ CTEs, CASE, subqueries, window functions
* Data visualization
* Data Wrangling
* Data Cleaning
* Data Science Notebook
* Snowflake Data warehouse
* Tableau
* Data Model
* SQL Code:

**Results & Business Recommendation:**

**Results:**
- [Tableau visualizations here]
- X% of subscriptions have hit an error
- X% of subscriptions have no opened the payment portal

**Business Recommendations:**
- Reduce friction on the enter payment page by considering Apple Pay, Google Pay, or other payment methods that don't require entering in a credit card every time. This will help reduce user errors due to incorrect payment info.
- Reach out to the 3rd party payment processing vendor and inquire about the errors on their side and determine a plan reduce those in the future.
Work with the product manager to increase the number of subscriptions that are opening the payment portal and attempting to pay. Since a large number of subscriptions aren't even going into the payment portal, we're losing a large number of opportunities at the beginning of the funnel, so maybe we can set up payment reminders or have customer service agent call them to encourage payment.
- Meet with Product Manager and UX/UI Design Team to consider making enhancements to the payment page to better highlight the next steps in the payment flow.

**Next Steps:**
* Investigate why subscriptions aren't even starting the payment process. 
* Conduct a deeper error type analysis to distinguish between user-side and vendor-side failures
* Investigate issues causing users to bypass the payment portal altogether. Is it a process issue on our side? Are customers forgetting? Potential technical barriers or lack of reminders?
